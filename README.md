# Image Colorization Using cGANs

This project explores the use of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) for automatic image colorization. The model is based on a U-Net generator and a PatchGAN discriminator, trained to predict the AB chrominance channels of a grayscale image in the LAB color space.
